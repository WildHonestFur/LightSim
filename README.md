This is a light sim built to understand the way light works and behaves.
You will find two main python files: Light.py and Light_Interactive.py

Light.py is a simulation that goes through all possible paths that light could travel between two media.
It shows that the path followed in real life is in accordance with the principle of least action and obeys Snell's law.

Light_Interactive.py is a more robust light sim that allows the user to play around with light, mirrors, and different media. It can be used to simulate various optical penomenon, including refraction, reflection and demonstrate the working everyday objects like lenses, fiberoptic cables, lasers, etc.

Updates to be made in the future...
