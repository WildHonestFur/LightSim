This is a light sim built to understand the way light works and behaves
You will find two main python files: Light.py and Light_Interactive.py

Light.py is a simulation that goes through all possible paths that light could travel between two media.
It shows that the path followed in real life is the most efficient, time wise, and obeys snells law

Light_Interactive.py is a more robust light sim that allows the user to play around with light, mirrors, and different media. It can be used to simulate various optical penomenon,
including refraction, reflection and demonstrate everyday objects like lenses, fiberoptic cables, lasers, etc.

Updates to be made in the future...
